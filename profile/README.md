# Pulse UI 

Pulse is a professional design system for web development. It supports pure HTML and CSS components. 

## Get Started 

Pulse UI will support: 
- `HTML` `CSS` 
- `Vue` 

> Pulse UI is still under development. A better CDN option will be available for Pulse UI in the future. 

### GitHub 

Fork the [Repository](https://github.com/PulseUI/pulseui.github.io/) and extract the `pulse.css` file for personal use. 

### CDN 

Pulse UI is available through a [JSDelivr CDN](https://jsdelivr.com) that connects to the github pages deployment. 

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/pulseui/pulseui.github.io/pulse.css"/>
```

It is better to place the CDN link **after** your website's stylesheets. 

## Alpine 

Pulse works well with Alpine if you are making static websites. The Pulse UI website uses material icons and Alpine to elevate UX. 

## Appearance 

Pulse UI components are inspired by [Material](https://material.io) but are much more lightweight and friendly to use. Pulse uses fewer nested elements to improve developer experience and deliver simple components. Ripple effects work smoothly and can be integrated seamlessly through a few lines of JavaScript. Pulse is also more customisable. The CSS can be replaced easily. 

## Ripple Effect 

Pulse UI uses [Ripplet](https://github.com/luncheon/ripplet.js) to achieve the awesome ripple effect.
